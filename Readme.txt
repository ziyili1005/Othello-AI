run.exe為介面程式
Ot8.exe為測試程式
Ot8b.c為新的基本程式，請從此程式修改
此程式與之前提供的程式新增的地方已註解在程式裡面的//20210529 edit************

測試方式如下：
在同一個目錄底下放入兩隻程式Ot8, Ot8b
開啟兩個命令提示字元視窗，分別執行
run Ot8 F 10
run Ot8b S 10
將會將兩隻程式分別以先後手交換方式，測試10局
測試完之後，會顯示贏家的勝率
或在執行完畢之後，執行run.exe，也可以看到贏家的勝率

請將以下11個檔案壓縮後上傳
result.txt
of_1*.txt
of_2*.txt
...
of_10*.txt

本作業將會以你的程式的勝率作為評分標準

run.exe is the interface program
Ot8.exe is a test program
Ot8b.c is a new basic program, please modify it from this program
The new places between this program and the previously provided programs have been annotated in the program //20210529 edit************

The test method is as follows:
Put two programs Ot8 and Ot8b in the same directory
Open two command prompt character windows and execute them separately
run Ot8 F 10
run Ot8b S 10
The two programs will be tested for 10 rounds by exchanging hands first and second respectively.
After the test is completed, the winner’s winning rate will be displayed.
Or after the execution is completed, execute run.exe and you can also see the winning rate of the winner.

Please compress the following 11 files and upload them
result.txt
of_1*.txt
of_2*.txt
...
of_10*.txt

This assignment will be graded based on the winning rate of your program.
